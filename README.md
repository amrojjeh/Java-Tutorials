# Welcome!
This is a Java crash course that I'm lecturing live in a Discord server. This repo is to store the code as well as converting the lectures into written lectures. Lots of work is going into this, so I hope you use it well! **Tip: Meetings with excercises are labeled with stars. If they come with solutions, they'll be labeled with two stars.**

## Covered:
- Java basics (meeting 1)
- Recursion* (meeting 2)
- Basics of classes (meeting 3)

## What's next:
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Access modifiers
- Packages
- Some fun with Discord bots
